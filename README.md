# Pandemic Simualtor
I made this over the course of my third semester as practical part of my Bachelor's Degree.

Includes live moving particles, measures like vaccines or social distancing and ajustable disease/mutation settings. 

The live graph shows infection/recovered/healthy rates and lets you export the data as a csv file.
